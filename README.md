# League-of-Legends-Summoner-Info-Project
A LoL lookup website for summoners including match history, masteries, runes and rank

This is the source code for a website I made using the League of Legends API.

- I used 'Bootstrap' for the css side of things.
- JavaScript was used to make API calls using AJAX.
- Data is saved to a MySql database using PHP.
- The login system is also handled with PHP and a MySql database.
